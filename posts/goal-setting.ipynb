    "*The knowledge we'll develop in CSCI 0451 can be broadly divided into four main areas:*\n",
    "\n",
    "- ***Theory***: *mathematical descriptions of frameworks and algorithms.*\n",
    "- ***Implementation***: *effective coding and use of tools in order to implement efficient machine learning algorithms.*\n",
    "- ***Experimentation***: *performing experiments to assess the performance of algorithms and clearly communicating about the results.*\n",
    "- ***Social responsibility***: *critical analysis of sources of bias and harm in machine learning algorithms; theoretical formulations of fairness and bias*\n",
    "\n",
    "*Every student should grow toward each of these areas, but you can choose to specialize if you'd like! If there are one or two of these categories on which you'd especially like to focus, list them below. Feel free to include any details that you'd like -- this can help me tailor the course content to your interests.*"

    "I am particularly interested in the Theory and Implementation. I would like to develop a strong foundation of exactly what is going on behind the scenes because until this course, Machine Learning has been somewhat of a mystery to me. I'm trying to not only understand Machine Learning concepts but apply them effectively in formats such as the blog posts but more importantly, in the final project which could incorporate real world data that carries significance to me (no offense to the Penguins on Dream Island)."

Blog posts will most frequently involve a mix of mathematical problem-solving, coding, experimentation, and written discussion. Some blog posts will ask you to critically discuss recent readings in an essay-like format.*"

You're expected to have prepared the warmup activity ahead of time (this means you'll need to have completed the readings as well). Each time, we'll sort into groups of 5-6 students, and one of you (randomly selected) will be responsible for presenting the activity on the whiteboard. If you're not feeling prepared to present the activity, you can \"pass\" to the next person, or ask for help along the way.*"

My expectation is that most projects will move significantly beyond the content covered in class in some way: you might implement a new algorithm, study a complex data set in depth, or conduct a series of experiments related to assessing algorithmic bias in a certain class of algorithm. You'll be expected to complete this project in small groups (of your choosing), and update us at a few milestones along the way.*\n",

    "I have a former teammate who is running a startup focused on connecting researchers with grants called ATOM, so I feel like there could be an opportunity to integrate machine learning with that process. I would have to talk to him to see where ML would be most useful. I would communicate with my team members to create a loose schedule that could be adjusted to ensure the workload is shared. I'm also interested in doing something sports related because I'm passionate about professional/collegiate athletics and the project would feel less like work. I hope to use this project as something I can build upon in my time after Middlebury as I continue to look for future employment. "
